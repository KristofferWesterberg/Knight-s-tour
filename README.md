# Knight's Tour
This project was developed for my final examination during my programming course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It focuses on solving the Knight's Tour problem, a classic chessboard puzzle.

# Description
**Knight's Tour** is a chessboard game that allows you to explore and visualize the movements of a knight on a chessboard. The objective is to find the longest possible route for a knight, visiting each square only once.

The game is divided into two main parts:

- **Create Route**: Users can create their own path for the knight, giving them the freedom to explore different strategies.
- **Longest Route**: Discover the longest possible route a knight can take, given a starting position. The feature uses Warnsdorff's rule (a heuristic algorithm) to calculate the longest route.
